# Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-ray Images

This Python script contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images as either indicative of pneumonia or normal.

## Overview

- `pneumonia_detection_model.ipynb`: Python script containing the entire code pipeline.
- `chest_xray/`: Directory structure containing training, validation, and test datasets.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.
2. Run the `pneumonia_detection_model.ipynb` script to train the model, evaluate its performance, generate predictions, and display sample test images with predictions.


## Outputs

- Trained model weights and architecture.
- Evaluation metrics on test data (loss and accuracy).
- Predictions for test data.
- Display of sample test images with predicted probabilities.

Feel free to modify hyperparameters, model architecture, or add more functionality as needed.

For more details, refer to the code comments within `pneumonia_detection_model.ipynb`.
